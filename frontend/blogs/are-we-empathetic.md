# What Is Empathy?

Empathy is the ability to put oneself in another person's shoes, which often involves discomfort and even pain. To be empathetic is to feel what another person is feeling and to understand their experiences. For instance, if someone has lost a close family member, saying "sorry" is an act of sympathy, expressing solidarity in their grief. Empathy, however, requires feeling their pain and supporting them in a way that helps them cope—whether by giving them space, recalling memories of the lost loved one, or sharing your own experiences of loss.

# How Can One Develop Empathy?

Being an attentive listener is essential to show genuine interest in what someone has to express. Empathy also involves imagining how someone feels. It is a crucial human trait that enhances relationships, improves understanding, and aids communication. Empathy includes both cognitive and emotional aspects: understanding another's perspective, imagining their thoughts and feelings, and, to some extent, experiencing their emotions.

### Difference Between Empathy and Sympathy

Empathy and sympathy are distinct concepts:

- **Empathy** involves actively understanding and sharing another person's feelings. It requires personal involvement and engagement. For example, showing empathy to a friend who has lost their job might involve understanding their anxiety, helping them find new opportunities, and staying involved in their journey.

- **Sympathy** is acknowledging someone's pain without deeply engaging with their emotions. For instance, saying, "I'm sorry, I hope you find a job soon," is an act of sympathy. It is easier to be sympathetic, as it often involves a surface-level acknowledgment of someone's distress.

While sympathy expresses solidarity, empathy fosters deeper connections by encouraging genuine interest and active support.

# In Summary

Both empathy and sympathy are important. Empathy helps build deep, long-lasting relationships, while sympathy allows us to express solidarity in a courteous way. Together, they contribute to a healthy and friendly society.
