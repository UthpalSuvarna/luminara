## Opening Thoughts

In a world increasingly shaped by competition and comparison, our children are bearing emotional burdens that are often invisible. Even those scoring 90% or more worry they’re not good enough. They overthink a single lost mark, compare themselves to others online, and constantly feel they’re falling short. As a former Principal of Manipal School, I’ve seen it time and again—brilliant students trapped in cycles of stress, self-doubt, and fear of failure.

It’s clear that academic success alone is no longer the goal—we must prioritize mental and emotional well-being to truly support our children. Sifting through my experiences, I realized there is one burning topic I really want to address that is…. how do we bring up children in today’s rapidly changing social situation.

As teachers/parents we think we have to cram their days with many activities. We dash them from one tuition class to another. We have unrealistic expectations from our children thus making them feel inadequate.

## The Emotional Cost of Performance Pressure

Mental health challenges are no longer rare among students—they’re becoming the norm. Stress, anxiety, social withdrawal, mood swings, and low self-esteem can quietly take root in the classroom. And yet, these warning signs often go unnoticed or are mistaken for "teenage moodiness."

We need to shift our collective focus from just how well students are performing to how well they are coping.

A school-wide Health, Safety, and Child Protection Policy is essential to creating a structured support system for students. Such a policy should:

* Appoint qualified wellness and safety officers
* Include periodic mental and physical health screenings
* Ensure all staff are trained in child protection and basic mental health first aid

## How Parents and Teachers Can Help

The home and classroom are where emotional foundations are laid. Here’s how adults can support student mental health:

- Listen without interrupting
- Acknowledge all emotions—especially the difficult ones
- Avoid comparisons between children
- Praise persistence and kindness, not just marks
* Allow time for rest, hobbies, and play

## Building Resilience: The Core of Emotional Strength

Resilience—the ability to recover from setbacks—is one of the most vital skills we can nurture. Instead of shielding children from failure, we must teach them how to handle it.

Schools can model this by:

* Creating a safe space for mistakes
* Encouraging reflective thinking over reactive behaviour
* Promoting peer empathy and cooperation over unhealthy competition

When a child learns to get up after a fall, they don’t just bounce back—they bounce forward.

## Closing Thoughts: What Truly Matters

Let us shift our focus from merely producing toppers to nurturing thinkers, creators, and emotionally grounded individuals. Mental health is not a luxury—it is the foundation of all learning and growth.

Our students deserve more than marks. They deserve peace of mind, a sense of belonging, and the tools to thrive—not just survive.
