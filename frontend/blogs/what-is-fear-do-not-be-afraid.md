## Story: Someone Jumped on the Terrace!

Recently, Rahul was alone at home since his parents had gone to the city. After saying prayers, he switched off the light and tried to sleep. Since he was alone that night, he couldn’t sleep, instantly tossing and turning in the bed.

By then, he heard a **‘thud!’** He started to think...
“Who must have jumped on the terrace?” His heart started pounding with fear. His mind said it was a rogue trying to cause trouble, knowing he was alone in the house.

His whole body and mind were focused on trying to hear the footsteps. He started to concentrate with utmost fear, but heard nothing. Then he began to think about different possibilities.

That’s when he calmed his mind, thinking about the alternate chances of that ‘thud’ noise.

First, he asked himself: *“Is that noise from the terrace or around?”*
He felt that it was not on the terrace but from the surroundings. If so, “what could be?” The only chance was that something might’ve fallen from the tree beside his bedroom, since he heard the ‘thud’ only once and didn’t hear any movement or footsteps later.

Oh! That thought brought some relief to him.

Then he decided that as soon as he woke up the next morning, he would check if that was a coconut.
And guess what? **Yes, it was a coconut.**
